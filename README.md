# techtide.github.io

This is my temporary homepage or, 'site directory'. I store some little web projects (and, I rarely work with web development) in here.

[Keybase](https://keybase.io/techtide)
* I love Keybase. :D

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/computer_time)

[SLD Accommodations Sign-up](https://techtide.github.io/sld) **early version, not released yet.**
* This was a short project I did to help my school's SLD department speed up their sign-up process and make it easier for students with accommodations. It is a portal for SLD test sign-ups.

[Cleanup](https://techtide.github.io/cleanup.html)
* A small support link for people of my game.

[CourseTube](https://techtide.github.io/coursetube)
* Being a student myself, I found that many students look towards many YouTube videos by different content creators for each of their courses. CourseTube is meant to be a user curated course videos system, which allows users to create different curriculums with different sets of videos, and vote on which work the best for them
