# techtide.github.io

This is my temporary homepage or, 'site directory'. I store some little web projects (and, I rarely work with web development) in here.

[Keybase](https://keybase.io/techtide)
* I love Keybase. :D

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/computer_time)

[SLD Accommodations Sign-up](https://techtide.github.io/sld) **early version, not released yet.**
* This was a short project I did to help my school's SLD department speed up their sign-up process and make it easier for students with accommodations. It is a portal for SLD test sign-ups.

[Cleanup](https://techtide.github.io/cleanup.html)
* A small support link for people of my game.

[CourseTube](https://techtide.github.io/coursetube)
* Being a student myself, I found that many students look towards many YouTube videos by different content creators for each of their courses. CourseTube is meant to be a user curated course videos system, which allows users to create different curriculums with different sets of videos, and vote on which work the best for them

[Space Demos](https://github.com/techtide/space-demos/blob/master/README.md)
* Ever wondered how to connect to satelites and leverage the plethoura of free,
    open, and even live space data? This was a blogpost/tutorial I made on how
    to do just that.

[NASA Wrapper](https://github.com/techtide/nasawrapper)
* I made a wrapper to make making neural networks and using AI with space data,
    and collecting all the space data needed, super simple. Seriously, all you
    need to do is modify a configuration text file!

    [TruTube](https://techtide.github.io/trutube/index.html)
    * Landing soon. A browser extension which uses artificial intelligence
        methods to classify good and credible educational material on the
        internet. Helping you learn faster and better, by allowing you to
        choose from the increasing amount of educational content on the web.
