This is my temporary homepage or, 'site directory'. I store some little web projects (and, I rarely work with web development) in here.

* I love Keybase. :D

[SLD Accommodations Sign-up](https://techtide.github.io/sld) **early version, not released yet.**
* This was a short project I did to help my school's SLD department speed up their sign-up process and make it easier for students with accommodations. It is a portal for SLD test sign-ups.
